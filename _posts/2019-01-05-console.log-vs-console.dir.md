The Angular CLI recently introduced a new command in version 6.0.0, ng add.
At a glance, it looks like an alternative to npm install but let us take a look
and see how the two approaches differ.

### ng add Overview

In short, ```ng add``` will use your package manager to download the specified dependency, just as you would using npm install. Once downloaded ng add will call an installation script which usually contains instructions on how to configure the project with the new dependency. These instructions will be carried out automatically by the CLI preventing users having to configure and add additional dependencies that could be required.

Give it a go now by starting a new project and use the Angular CLI to add Angular Material, see below.

Commands used below:
```
ng new sampleProject
ng add @angular/material
```
![ng add in action]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ngAdd.gif "ng add in action")
